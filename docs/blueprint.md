## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#6699CC), suggestive of professional settings.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF). It maintains a consistent visual association with professionalism, yet it is light enough as to not be distracting.
- Accent color: Muted green (#8FBC8F). Because this will mostly appear with contact information, this color reinforces the association of life, renewal and nature to contacts.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headers. Use of sans-serif keeps the styling simple and clean.
- Use clear, minimalist icons for different contact details and actions (e.g., phone, email, edit, delete).
- Clean, card-based layout for displaying contact information, with a consistent structure.
- Subtle transitions and animations for opening contact details and editing information.
